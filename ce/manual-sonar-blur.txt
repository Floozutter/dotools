here's how to manually scan for the sonar blur value in Cat Goes Fishing:
- it's a double
- less than or equal to 0 where there is no sonar blur visible
- greater than or equal to 1 when there is only sonar blur visible
- move towards and away from sources of sonar blur to scan for differences
- move along multiple axes to filter out coordinate values
- wait and scan for unchanged values before moving to next position for cleaner results

i tried injecting some code to freeze the value at 0 but...
the instructions that access it also access a lot of other addresses...
so i got a lot of crashes...
what a pain
